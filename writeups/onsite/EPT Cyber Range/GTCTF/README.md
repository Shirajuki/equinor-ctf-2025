# EPT Cyber Range
**Authors:** tmolberg and nordbo

## Challenge
Once again the dreaded EPT Cyber Range had returned for it's third year. And third times the charm right?? right?!?

note: I did not solve the challange (get 3 round) but I got 2, and was so close..

### Challange Description
```
We're back for a third year! This time it's all about bitwise operations. You get the flag after two rounds, but more important; you and two team mates get a coin if you place in the top 3!

GL HF aimers!

Still the best Cyber Range in Norway!
```

### Process

This is the third time Cyber Range has been included as one of the tasks. The concept is fairly simple: You get a calculation you have to do with some quick mental math, and then you have supply the answer by hitting the corresponding targets representing the 8 bit binary answer.

Mental calculations have never been my strong suit, and after a few tries the other years, I concluded thas this was reserved for superhumans that dreams in hexadecimal. Nevertheless I had a look at this years setup. 
At first glance it looked intimidating. XOR two hexadecimal numbers. For example 0x93^0x3b = A8 = 10101000.
