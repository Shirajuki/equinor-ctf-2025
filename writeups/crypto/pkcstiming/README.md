## Description
```
You've discovered a misconfigured oracle. During your investigation, you've intercepted a message—along with its corresponding public key.

By poking around, you've managed to connect to the oracle using the connection helper. However, you haven't yet figured out the correct message size required to communicate with it properly.

Hint: The key to solving this lies in the timing. Strongly recommend utalizing the pwnbox for the best performance.
